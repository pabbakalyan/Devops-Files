apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: react-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: react-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80  # The port exposed by the service within the cluster
      targetPort: 3000  # The port your React app is listening on inside the pod
  type: LoadBalancer

apiVersion: Specifies the API version for the Service, which is v1.

kind: Specifies the type of Kubernetes resource, which is a Service in this case.

metadata: Contains metadata about the Service, including its name.

spec: Describes the desired state for the Service.

selector: Specifies the pods that the service will route traffic to.

app: react-app: Selects pods with the label app: react-app.
ports: Specifies the ports that the service should expose.

protocol: Specifies the protocol (TCP).

port: Specifies the port (80) on which the service will be accessible within the cluster.

targetPort: Specifies the port (3000) on which the pods (with the app: react-app label) are listening.

type: Specifies the type of service, which is a LoadBalancer. This makes the service accessible from outside the cluster.
The actual behavior might depend on the Kubernetes cluster environment.

In summary, these YAML files define a Deployment for running three replicas of a React app in containers and a Service to expose
that app outside the cluster using a LoadBalancer. The app's Docker image is specified, and communication between the 
Service and the pods is set up through ports.
