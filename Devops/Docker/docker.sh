is necessary after building  the artifacts to write a docker file and deploy into the server or instead building  the artifactory  like mvn clean install, go build, npm run build, commands and deployed into server

The decision to use Docker or not in your deployment process depends on various factors, including your application's requirements, the deployment environment, and your team's preferences. Let's explore both approaches:

1. Direct Deployment without Docker:

If your project only involves a single application or service and doesn't have complex dependencies, deploying the artifacts directly to a server might be a straightforward option. In this case, you would execute the necessary build commands (e.g., mvn clean install, go build, npm run build) and then copy the resulting artifacts to your server.

Advantages:

Simplicity: Direct deployment can be simpler, especially for smaller projects with fewer dependencies.
Familiarity: If your team is already comfortable with direct deployment and your application's requirements are met, there may be no need for Docker.

Considerations:

Dependency Management: Ensure that all dependencies (runtime, libraries, etc.) are installed and configured correctly on the server.
Isolation: Consider whether the deployment environment might have conflicts with dependencies or versions.
2. Deployment with Docker:
Using Docker involves creating a Docker image that encapsulates your application and its dependencies. You would write a Dockerfile to describe the image, and then you can deploy instances of this image to your servers or a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).

Dockerfile Example (for a Node.js app):

Dockerfile
Copy code
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the app source code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run your app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
Advantages:

Isolation: Docker containers encapsulate dependencies, providing a consistent environment across different servers.
Portability: Docker images are portable and can be deployed across different environments seamlessly.
Versioning: Docker images can be versioned, making it easier to roll back to previous versions if needed.
Considerations:

Learning Curve: If your team is not familiar with Docker, there might be a learning curve.
Resource Overhead: Docker introduces some resource overhead, and you need to consider whether it aligns with your project's requirements.
Decision Factors:
Consider the following factors when deciding whether to use Docker or not:

Project Complexity: For simple projects with few dependencies, direct deployment might be sufficient. For complex projects with multiple services and dependencies, Docker can provide better isolation and manageability.

Deployment Environment: If you have control over the deployment environment and can ensure consistent configurations, direct deployment might be easier. Docker offers a consistent environment across different platforms.

Team Familiarity: Consider your team's familiarity with Docker. If the team is comfortable with Docker and the benefits it provides align with your project's needs, it might be a good choice.

Scaling and Orchestration: If your project requires scaling or orchestration, Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes become more valuable.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on your specific project requirements and the trade-offs that align with your team's expertise and workflow.
